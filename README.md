## Just another VueJS starter
This starter uses latest TypeScript enhancements introduced in VueJS 2.5 as well as other plugins and tools which make development easier. As a result: type checking, tslint, intellisense in single-file-components written in TypeScript.


### Essential parts:
 - completely based on vue-cli webpack template
 - no unit tests (things to improve)
 - Vue `2.5.2` (runtime-only build since everything is in `.vue` files)
 - vue-router `3.0.1`
 - TypeScript `2.7.2`
 - tslint - [tslint-config-standard](https://github.com/blakeembrey/tslint-config-standard)
 - Single File Components
 - Webpack `3.6.0`
 - Hot Module Replacement
 - [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) `3.5.0` & [fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin) `0.4.1`
 - starter doesn't use [vue-class-component](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-class-component)
 - vscode: [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur) & [TSLint Vue](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prograhammer.tslint-vue)
